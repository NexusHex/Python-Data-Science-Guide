Python is very useful for a lot of things, but it excels at modelling things for data science
purposes, like managing large groups of numbers and plotting graphs. This project folder will go
through everything that you need to learn the basics of data science using Python, through
libraries like Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.

Well, I won't waste any more of your time, so go ahead and check out the file under this one!
