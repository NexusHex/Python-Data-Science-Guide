Universal functions are very fast functions that are used to implement vectorization on an array(s)

Vectorization is converting iterables (list, array, tuple, dictionary etc.) into vectors.
This is faster than iterating over the iterable using something like a for loop, since computer CPUs are better designed for vectorization rather than iteration

Universal functions save you time on the keyboard, and at runtime, so there really isn't any harm in using them in your code to boost its efficiency.

Good luck with learning about these cool functions!
NOTE: I will skip some of the topics that were taught since they do not apply to everyday life as a coder, like creating logarithms
