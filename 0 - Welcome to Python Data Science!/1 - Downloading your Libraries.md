First off, you need to get the powers needed to manipulate the data in the first place!

These are the packages you will need to use in this project:
> Numpy
> 
> Pandas
>
> Matplotlib (specifically the pyplot submodule)
>
> Seaborn

Make sure you have Python installed to its latest version (3.12.0 at the time of writing this)
and install these modules in the command prompt/terminal using pip!
> Note: If you are using Pycharm, then you should follow the instructions in the section listed
> after this one, since you do not have to download libraries using pip.

### WINDOWS INSTALL:
To download the libraries required on a Windows machine, you can type out the following into the
Command Prompt application:

>> python -m pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
>> 
> Or...
>
>> py -m pip install numpy
>> 
>> py -m pip install pandas
>>
>> py -m pip install matplotlib
>>
>> py -m pip install seaborn
>>
>> Make sure to let one installation finish, then start the next one

This will download all 4 libraries. Let it download and move on once it's finished!

### MAC/UNIXOS INSTALL:
To download the libraries on a Mac, use this text snippet in the Terminal application:

>> python3 -m pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
>>
> Or...
>
>> python3 -m pip install numpy
>>
>> python3 -m pip install pandas
>> 
>> python3 -m pip install matplotlib
>> 
>> python3 -m pip install seaborn
>> 
>> Make sure to let one installation finish, then start the next one

This will download all 4 libraries. Let it download and move on once it's finished!

## IF YOU ARE USING PYCHARM AS YOUR PYTHON INTERPRETER:
If you are using Pycharm to interpret Python, then you will have to do things a slightly different way...
1. Create a new Project
2. Navigate your cursor to the ribbon on the left side of the screen and select '**Python Packages**'
3. Click the search bar that says 'Search for more packages' and type out the first library that you would like to install (I will pretend like we are choosing Numpy for the sake of simplicity)
4. Select the top result (there are many packages available for Python that may not be safe, so make sure that you are choosing the right one!) and click the 'install' button.
5. Wait for the library to install, then search for the next library and repeat from step 4 until you have downloaded Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn

And now you have all the libraries that you need! Good luck and move onto 1 - Numpy!
